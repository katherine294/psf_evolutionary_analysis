# An evolutionary analysis of phytopathogen Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. fraxini, casual agent of ash canker

### A comparative genetic and phenotypic analysis to identify evolutionary processes driving trait diversification in P. savastanoi pv. fraxini. 

### Background: ### Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. fraxini (Psf) is a phytopathogenic bacterium responsible for the formation of distinctive erumpent cankers on European ash (Fraxinus excelsior). It belongs to the P. syringae species complex — a diverse group of plant-associated bacteria that have served as models for studying virulence, adaptation, and evolution.

Although ash canker is widespread across the UK and parts of Europe, the biology and ecology of Psf remain poorly understood. Understanding its population structure and evolutionary mechanisms is particularly important as European ash populations face multiple threats, including ash dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) and the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis). How these interacting stressors shape Psf populations is currently unknown.

Summary: This study combines comparative genomics with phenotypic characterisation to investigate the evolutionary processes underlying diversification in Psf. Whole-genome sequencing was carried out on 169 isolates collected from multiple woodland sites. Analyses of the core genome were used to infer rates of evolution, recombination, and dissemination across populations, while pangenome analyses identified patterns of gene gain and loss that provide insight into horizontal gene transfer and adaptation. Variation in virulence- and effector-associated genes was explored to assess differences in pathogenic potential among isolates.

These genomic approaches were integrated with phenotypic assays of ecologically relevant traits, including swarming motility and biosurfactant production, to identify variants associated with adaptive phenotypes. Together, these results reveal patterns of population structure, gene flow, and functional diversification that illuminate the evolutionary ecology of P. savastanoi pv. fraxini.
