# Purpose: reproducible pipeline for processing bacterial WGS: download, QC, trimming, mapping (Snippy), core alignment, recombination detection (Gubbins), masking of MGEs + recombination, phylogeny (RAxML-NG), collapsing poorly supported clades, and coverage analysis (mosdepth).
# Cluster: Designed for BlueBEAR (University of Birmingham). Uses module for system software and mamba/conda for small utilities (gotree, mosdepth)
# Prerequisites: Reference FASTA placed at reference_sequences/246539E_W163A3B1.fasta (or edit REF_DIR in scripts).
